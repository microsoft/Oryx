# Testing

To run react-app-rewired tests use the command `npm run test`. To run playwright tests run `npm run playwright_test`. In order to run tests npm install had to be changed to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`, sample no longer works with `npm install` because  react-compound-slider uses an outdated version of react.
