# Base image

PHP runtime images are layered on Docker's [official PHP
images](https://github.com/docker-library/php).

## System packages

The Apache HTTP Server  is used as the application server.
The following PHP extensions are installed & enabled in the runtime images:

* pdo
* pdo_sqlsrv
* pdo_mysql
* pdo_pgsql
* pgsql
* ldap

* gmp
* zip
* bcmath
* mbstring
* pcntl
* calendar
* exif
* gettext
* imap
* redis
* tidy
* shmop
* soap
* sockets
* sysvmsg
* sysvsem
* sysvshm
* pdo_odbc

# Detect

The PHP toolset will run when the following conditions are met:
1. `composer.json` file exists in the root of the repository.

2. Files with `.php` extension in root of repository or in any sub-directories.

# Build

The following process is applied for each build:

1. Run custom script if specified by `PRE_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.
1. Run `php composer.phar install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-interaction` if composer file found.
1. Run custom script if specified by `POST_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.

## Package manager

The latest version of *Composer* is used to install dependencies.

# Run

The following process is applied to determine how to start an app:

1. If user has specified a start script, run it.
1. Else, run `apache2-foreground`.

# Version support

The PHP project defines this [release schedule][]. Oryx supports all [actively supported releases](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).

We will update the `patch` version of a release at least once every 3 months,
replacing the previous `patch` version for that release.
